            <p>
                broke his right olecranon in the summer of 2022, resulting in the surgical 
                implanting of two, four-inch-long nails through the crook of his elbow. <br>
                Rob is a commendable artist, composer, performer, writer, and storyteller from the West 
                edge of England. His accepting embrace of the subtlety and imperfection of human nature 
                has successfully laid the groundwork for producing honest and intimate works of art, theatre, and music. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of 2023, Rob shaved his shoulder length hair to the scalp for added 'shock factor' 
                in the performance of his work <i>Rondo a la Womb</i>. The self-administered haircut was
                unsuccessful in parts, resulting in mixed feedback from his peers: "you look like a baby duck", claimed 
                one member of the audience. <br>
                Throughout 2023-24, Rob worked amongst a dynamic team of theatre 
               makers at <a href="https://rogueotherworld.co.uk" target="_blank">Rogue Otherworld</a>,
               collaborating in the creation and production of "immersive wild theatre 
               that celebrates the wonders of life, culture, human connection and our connectedness with nature". 
               Rob also appeared on stage with the team year-round, including shows at Glastonbury Festival and in 
               the wilds of Tehidy Woods, Cornwall. Moving away from Cornwall at the end of 2024, Rob now works as a 
               multi-instrumental music teacher at <a href="https://www.rocksteadymusicschool.com" target="_blank">Rocksteady Music School</a>. 
               This is surrounded by a plethora of creative work of his own.
               These works explore the issues, beauties, and subtleties 
               that we encounter in our everyday life, covering a range of outputs from experimental performance
                pieces, to innovative installations, contemporary audio-visual compositions, and live theatre
                 experiences.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Artificial intelligence can be a remarkably effective tool in various
                 applications, but it can also evoke a sense of terror. The natural world holds a sacred status
                  that demands our respect and protection at any expense. This composition aims to explore the
                   conflict between human and robotic performance, offering insight into our collective culpability
                    and awareness of our impact on the environment. At the same time, it instils a sense of unease,
                    highlighting the urgency of immediate action. It's worth noting that this statement was generated
                     using artificial intelligence.

            <h3>THE SOFT DRINK SUITE</h3>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">An artist is consistently pulled from alignment to alignment through bouts of inspiration and commiseration.
                 When an artist finds meaning in situation, they must clutch hold and make their concept a reality. This reality was hard to materialise,
                  yet it brought with it a new-found love for the hardship of making art.

            <h3>BOUNDARIES OF ILLUSTRATION</h3>
            <h4>January 2023 - Audio-visual composition collaboration with illustrator

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Given the necessary sense to consume music is one's hearing, the visual element can be interpreted 
                in many ways. This collaborative work for piano serves as an insight into the possibilities of the interaction between 
                a sound artist and a visual artist when the brief holds no constraints.

                Art not without ambition, but without -
                The illness should attend it.

            <h3>OBSERVATIONS OF THE EARLY YEARS</h3>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Education is the only essential component to all of us artist's work. Mr. Sunak's pre-prime-ministerial pledge
            to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/07/rishi-sunak-vows-to-end-low-earning-degrees-in-post-16-education-shake-up" target="_blank">phase out university degrees that do not improve students' "earning potential"</a> 
            has set itself in place to kill off the art that we create. The essence of this project exists to directly combat this brutal murder and 
            is observed from the very source, the early years.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">The first time that man flipped a switch and heard his own voice emitted through electronic signals, they
                would have been enamoured. Fast-forward a century or so, and we have little magic metal books that can process that information in an instant, 
                and manipulate it with infinite possibilities. It leaves us with the question: are we better artists when we are given more, less, or no constraints at all?

            <h3>REQUIEM FOR LOST SPECIES</h3>
            <h4>November 2021 - Sound art composition with Amanda Brown for <a href="https://art-earth.org.uk" target="_blank">art.earth</a> (now defunct): 3 mins.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 150px;">In collaboration with Amanda Brown (connected through Falmouth 
                University), <i>Requiem for Lost Species</i> was composed as a sound art experiment that 
                made use of the cries, calls, and clamours of various endangered and extinct species.
                 The piece heavily features Morse code as a rhythmic and narrative device attempting
                  to supply the animals themselves with a voice they can use to convey their 
                  suffering. The work was showcased at a talk with the organisation 'art.earth'
                  called 'Borrowed Time with Caroline Hickman'.
