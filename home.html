        <h2 id="C1">1. Biography.</h2>

            <p>
                If all stories start at the beginning, then what do we do with the ones that
                 haven’t ended yet? You might be wondering who I am and how I know
                  Mr. Harrison. Well, I am him, and they are me. We are Rob Harrison. Welcome
                   to the coffee shop catastrophe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, why not start in the middle? It’s probably been done before, right? 
                Mr. Harrison broke his elbow in the summer of 2022. He ejected himself from 
                the seat of his bicycle for no reason other than a lapse in judgement and partial
                equipment failure. There was no suit filed, no insurance claim attempted, 
                for Mr. Harrison gives these processes limited respect and regard. The bicycle 
                had to be parked up for a while. In this time, the young apprentice gave himself
                 time to heal by breaking down all sense of routine, relationships, and positive
                  practices. All in favour of living inside his own head for a while. The results
                   of which have not yet emerged out the other end of his conceptual factory,
                    but Mr. Harrison assures me it is in favour of art. Art hurts. Art heals. 
                    Art is whatever you want it to be, as long is makes you, the people around you, 
                    anyone, <b>feel something</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="mesinging.JPG" style="height: 250px; float: inline-end; margin: 10px;">
            <p>Elation was learned on the stage for Robert - the form of his name only uttered by members of his 
                family. The sweaty embraces and overwhelming relief that it all went okay was
                 the realest of feelings. Becoming known as ‘good at the sinister roles’ was perhaps 
                 not Robert’s initial aim, but he was just happy to be good at something, and part 
                 of a group. The curtains haven’t pulled for a while in this one’s life. Covid could 
                 take the blame amongst a range of causation, however, Robert always remembers these 
                 times and relishes what they have inspired him to create since.</p>
            <p>As a young artist there is a steady balance of both overwhelming pressures to do 
                something and no pressure to do anything. You are freed by your punching bag of a 
                youthful body and exuberance often touted by those with years senior. On the other 
                hand, Rob, your father isn’t too pleased with your choice in career, I think. Careers
                 are supposed to make money, right? The substance that makes the world go round. 
                 Why not, Rob? Make all the money in the world, then you’ll be happy. Just like your 
                 father. On the other hand, spit in the face of the investment banker and help those
                  around you because it makes you feel good. There is always a way to survive and 
                  live your life while hurting as little people as possible. You will find it, Rob,
                   you will.</p>

            <h3>THE SAILOR IS UNSURE</h3>
            <h4>December 2022 - 2<sup>nd</sup> year university project.</h4>

            <p style="margin: 0px;">I like singing. I am from the South-West. Therefore, it may
                 come as a surprise that the inspiration for this piece actually came from a 
                 videogame. Pirates are quite cool, after all. This composition features several
                  pre-existing sea shanties compiled into a work that explores the appropriation
                   of sailor culture and complex issues with the global voice throughout history.

            <h3>MUSIC FOR PRACTICE ROOMS</h3>

            <p style="margin: 0px;">COVID-19 had affected everyone in different ways. Amongst the 
                health scares and educational issues, my life in the arts was ambushed in an instant.
                As a prolific ensemble performer and lover of collaboration, the instant halt put 
                on any gathering led to my passion for music taking a hit. When we were eventually
                 allowed to return to group practice, the rehearsals were an awkward balance of 
                 social distancing and cold drafts, all while trying to produce a coherent sound 
                 together. Another new challenge was the open doors and windows allowing sound to 
                 come from other practice rooms while we were playing. I found this incredibly 
                 frustrating up until I began to embrace the contemporary and alternative nature
                  of this new predicament. Occasionally the distant sounds would even synchronise 
                  in their own way and create something new, completely by chance. This piece was 
                  recorded with a handheld microphone from a member of the audience, while playback 
                  occurs across several practice rooms in a corridor.

            <p style="margin: 0px;">Throughout my adolescent musical career, I had a shortage of 
                training or practice in the world of music technology. This piece stands to
                 represent the magnitude of learning that took place since leaving school. There
                  is a plethora of sample manipulation, effects control, mixing, and layering 
                  that is taking place here to help reach an artist outcome I was aiming for.

            <p style="margin: 0px;">While working on a module heavily focused on the industry, 
                I put together a collection of films that I had written, directed, and produced 
                myself to further practice my writing for moving image. This short project kicked 
                off a now permanent interest in art forms that stretch the limitations of music 
                alone and start to tamper with more than the one sense. The videos are hosted on 
                a stand-alone YouTube channel.

                Passing [for Solo Trombone and Loop Pedal] - Score</a></p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">As my first compositional assignment at Falmouth University, 
                I was eager to showcase my skills and knowledge as a composer interested in
                 advanced methods and contemporary techniques. A solo for trombone and loop pedal,
                  Passing is a challenging piece designed to push the boundaries of what a single
                   monophonic instrument is capable of in a stand-alone composition. Further
                    information on the narrative and emotive background as well as instructions 
                    relating to the alternate notation can be found in the score linked above.

            <p><img src="borrowedtime.png" height="400px" style="padding: 20px;"></p>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">In collaboration with Amanda Brown (connected through Falmouth 
                University), Requiem for Lost Species was composed as a sound art experiment that 
                made use of the cries, calls, and clamours of various endangered and extinct species.
                 The piece heavily features Morse code as a rhythmic and narrative device attempting
                  to supply the animals themselves with a voice they can use to convey their 
                  suffering. My work was then showcased at a talk with the organisation ‘art.earth’ 
                  called ‘Borrowed Time with Caroline Hickman’.

            <p style="margin: 0px;">To return to my love for the jazz band and traditional scoring,
                 and as part of my A Level submission, this piece  tests the edges of technique and precision, akin to the
                 ‘tightness’ of my favourite band at the time, 
                 <a href="https://www.snarkypuppy.com" target="_blank">Snarky Puppy</a>. It also 
                 features a written  solo for my own instrument, trombone. This piece is yet to be 
                 performed.
            </p>
            
            <h3>NORMAL PEOPLE</h3>

            </audio>
            <p style="margin: 0px;">This work was initially produced as an inaugural exercise in music 
                production using a DAW. Prior to this, I had only worked with acoustic instruments and notation 
                software to practice my composition. The piece follows a programmatic narrative reflecting the 
                positive and negative impacts of ambition and human development. I later refined the piece to 
                use as a submission for A Level music in 2021.

            <h4>December 2022 - "I like to ride my bicycle"</h4>
            <img src="backonthebike.jpeg" style="height: 350px; float: inline-end; margin: 10px;">
            <p>Heavy breathing fucking sucks. Ice-cold lungs juxtaposed with clammed up sweat and the smell of 
                cow shit emanating from the fields around me. I am home once more.</p>
            <p>Since my arm went snap in August, I haven’t been able to ride my bike for months. I have also 
                been dealing with some other pretty nasty stuff, but we don’t need to get into that. This lovely
                 potion of all-around fuckery and my lack of motivation to do anything about it, has led to 
                 some difficult battles with my own mental health. In the past, creativity has been a one-stop 
                 outlet for issues that I am processing, but I’m afraid that this time, it hasn’t helped so much.
                  That’s when I suddenly realised that as outlets go, creativity is but a small part. I have my 
                  family, my friends, sometimes videogames, a good film, and perhaps most importantly: sport.
                   If you want some more detail on my relationship with sport and the arts, head over to
                 ‘sport vs creativity’ in my ‘Eyes See, Ears Hear’ film project.</p>
            <p>I am back on my bike now. I am also starting to seek out some people that may know a bit more 
                than I about how my mushy brain is being slapped about at the moment, and the right methods 
                to point it back in a positive direction. Some of the things coming up in the new year include
                 a start to a new semester at uni, maybe I will actually get my cards in order early on and 
                 feel good about the workload throughout… sure. I will be focusing much more on the contemporary 
                 world next year and trying to work out how to live while being interested in what I make. 
                 I will also be taking the plunge on my van, ready to bum around the country all summer, 
                 on me tod. Merry Christmas.</p>
