            <p>
                broke his right olecranon in the summer of 2022, resulting in the surgical 
                implanting of two, four-inch-long nails through the crook of his elbow. <br>
                Rob is a commendable artist, composer, performer, writer, and storyteller from the West 
                edge of England. His accepting embrace of the imperfection and subtlety of human nature 
                has successfully laid the groundwork for producing honest and intimate works of art, theatre, and music. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                At the beginning of 2023, Rob shaved his shoulder length hair to the scalp for added 'shock factor' 
                in the performance of his work <i>Rondo a la Womb</i>. The self-administered haircut was
                unsuccessful in parts, resulting in mixed feedback from his peers: "you look like a baby duck", claimed 
                one member of the audience. <br>
                Graduating from university in 2024, Rob is currently working amongst the dynamic team of theatre 
                makers at <a href="https://rogueotherworld.co.uk" target="_blank">Rogue Otherworld,</a>
                 collaborating in the creation and production of "immersive wild theatre 
                that celebrates the wonders of life, culture, human connection and our connectedness with nature". 
                Rob also appears on stage with the team year-round, including shows at Glastonbury Festival and in 
                the wilds of Tehidy Woods, Cornwall. This packed performance schedule is surrounded by a variety of 
                works of Rob's own direction. These works explore the issues, beauties, and subtleties 
                that we encounter in our everyday life, from a theatre piece involving the manufacturing of an
                alternate persona consumed by an other-worldly being devoted to warning the human race of the 
                dangers of ambition, to a contemporary audio-visual composition calling for the appearance of a 
                tree faerie to challenge the misinformation and greenwashing we face from technologically advanced 
                corporations every day.

                 detectors to this day.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Artificial intelligence can be a remarkably effective tool in various
                 applications, but it can also evoke a sense of terror. The natural world holds a sacred status
                  that demands our respect and protection at any expense. This composition aims to explore the
                   conflict between human and robotic performance, offering insight into our collective culpability
                    and awareness of our impact on the environment. At the same time, it instils a sense of unease,
                    highlighting the urgency of immediate action. It's worth noting that this statement was generated
                     using artificial intelligence.

            <h3>THE SOFT DRINK SUITE</h3>
            <h4>April 2023 - Audio-visual instillation: 9 mins.</h4>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">An artist is consistently pulled from alignment to alignment through bouts of inspiration and commiseration.
                 When an artist finds meaning in situation, they must clutch hold and make their concept a reality. This reality was hard to materialise,
                  yet it brought with it a new-found love for the hardship of making art.

            <h3>BOUNDARIES OF ILLUSTRATION</h3>
            <h4>January 2023 - Audio-visual composition collaboration with illustrator
                 <a href="https://www.emmaogormanillustration.com" target="_blank">Emma O'Gorman</a>: 5 mins.</h4>

            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Given the necessary sense to consume music is one's hearing, the visual element can be interpreted 
                in many ways. This collaborative work for piano serves as an insight into the possibilities of the interaction between 
                a sound artist and a visual artist when the brief holds no constraints.       
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">The arts perform and performing is art. Thou wouldst be great -
                Art not without ambition, but without -
                The illness should attend it.

            <h3>OBSERVATIONS OF THE EARLY YEARS</h3>
            <h4>January 2023 - Sound and visual piece for <a href="https://cmst.co.uk/earlyyearsmusic" target="_blank">CMST Early Years</a>: 3 mins.</h4>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">Education is the only essential component to all of us artist's work. Mr. Sunak's pre-prime-ministerial pledge
            to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/07/rishi-sunak-vows-to-end-low-earning-degrees-in-post-16-education-shake-up" target="_blank">phase out university degrees that do not improve students' "earning potential"</a> 
            has set itself in place to kill off the art that we create. The essence of this project exists to directly combat this brutal murder and 
            is observed from the very source, the early years.          
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">The first time that man flipped a switch and heard his own voice emitted through electronic signals, they
                would have been enamoured. Fast-forward a century or so, and we have little magic metal books that can process that information in an instant, 
                and manipulate it with infinite possibilities. It leaves us with the question: are we better artists when we are given more, less, or no constraints at all?

            <h3>REQUIEM FOR LOST SPECIES</h3>
            <h4>November 2021 - Sound art composition with Amanda Brown for <a href="https://art-earth.org.uk" target="_blank">art.earth</a> (now defunct): 3 mins.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 150px;">In collaboration with Amanda Brown (connected through Falmouth 
                University), Requiem for Lost Species was composed as a sound art experiment that 
                made use of the cries, calls, and clamours of various endangered and extinct species.
                 The piece heavily features Morse code as a rhythmic and narrative device attempting
                  to supply the animals themselves with a voice they can use to convey their 
                  suffering. The work was showcased at a talk with the organisation 'art.earth'
                  called 'Borrowed Time with Caroline Hickman'.
